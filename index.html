    <div class="center" style="width: 80%;">
        <p>Everyone is exposed to levels of contamination from natural and technological sources in varying proportions, depending on their geographical location, lifestyle, genes run in families and more. The risk of cancer is obvious but can be reduced by changes in many factors, such as diet, environmental exposures, or even mood. Many centers have conducted research in cancer to help reduce and prevent the impact it carries. In this mini-project, I want to study the relationship between the amount of cancer cases and power plant sites, waste sites, etc and provide specific information for people in counties or states in the United States. 
        </p>
        <p>The United States is home to a wide variety of power stations. The National Priorities List (NPL) is the list of sites of national priority among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States and its territories. 
            With data about cancer cases trend, power stations and Superfund sites, I drawed a graph below provides an overview of them.
        </p>
        <iframe style="width: 800px; height: 500px;" src="graphs/US_county_cancer_poll_map.html"></iframe>
        <p><br> Almost every county in the United States has cancer cases although Kansas and Minnesota's cancer data are missing. By plotting the histogram graph of cancer cases per 100000 people, 
            we can see the distribution of cancer cases per 100000 people. 
           The number of counties are generally normally distributed among different counties in the US.</p>

        <p><br>What causes the difference among counties? How different factors affect people's health?<br>
            To solve these questions, let's first look at the US power plants. Below is the map plotting by the sum of gigawatt hours of states. 
            If the state is more blue, it produces more power. And if the state is more grey, it stores more power. As we can see from the plot, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Florida and Arizona are the top 5 state produce or store power.
