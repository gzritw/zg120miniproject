        <p>Everyone is exposed to levels of contamination from natural and technological sources in varying proportions, depending on their geographical location, lifestyle, genes run in families and more. The risk of cancer is obvious but can be reduced by changes in many factors, such as diet, environmental exposures, or even mood. Many centers have conducted research in cancer to help reduce and prevent the impact it carries. In this mini-project, I want to study the relationship between the amount of cancer cases and power plant sites, waste sites, etc and provide specific information for people in counties or states in the United States. 
        </p>
        <p>The United States is home to a wide variety of power stations. The National Priorities List (NPL) is the list of sites of national priority among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States and its territories. 
            With data about cancer cases trend, power stations and Superfund sites, I drawed a graph below provides an overview of them.
        </p>
        <iframe style="width: 800px; height: 500px;" src="graphs/US_county_cancer_poll_map.html"></iframe>
        <p><br> Almost every county in the United States has cancer cases although Kansas and Minnesota's cancer data are missing. By plotting the histogram graph of cancer cases per 100000 people, 
            we can see the distribution of cancer cases and its trend rate per 100000 people. 
           The number and trend rate of counties are generally normally distributed among different counties in the US.</p>

        <p><br>What causes the difference among counties? How different factors affect people's health?<br>
            To solve these questions, let's first look at the US power plants. Below is the map plotting by the sum of gigawatt hours of states. 
            If the state is more blue, it produces more power. And if the state is more grey, it stores more power.
            As we can see from the plot, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Florida and Arizona are the top 5 state produce or store power.

    <div class="center" style="width: 80%;">
        <p><br>Superfund sites may also influence the health of local people with regard to cancer.
        The epa.gov provides a map (see below) for all the sites in the United States. Sites gather mostly along the East and West coast. Density of sites in New England Area is extremely high.
        Will these sites have positive or negative effect to cancer? I will discuss more later.

            <p></p>
            <p> By drawing a correlation plot and a correlation matrix, we can easily see the correlation between different features. 
                Here with the plot below, we can know the relationship between cancer cases per 100000 people and features such as
                fips, trend rate of cancer, Superfund sites, score index and power plants. 
                It shows that superfund sites and score index are most closely related. 
                Power plants have close relation with Superfund sites and score index. 
                Since score index represents the Superfund site's cleaness, we can believe that Superfund sites and powerplants are strongly related to each other.

    <div class="center" style="width: 80%;">
        <p><br>There are many kinds of power plants and Superfund sites. They use different kinds of fuel: waste, coal, hydro, oil, geothermal, biomass, petcoke, nuclear, wind, solar energy.
        With similar methods as above, petcoke, nuclear, geothermal, biomass shows relationship between cancer cases. But boxplots for these four fuel 
        below indicates that, for counties who have or do not have these kinds of plants, there is no big difference of cancer cases.
        </p>

    <div class="center" style="width: 80%;">
        <p><br>Also, there are some plants in top 20 cancer cases in the US. It is interesting that
        most of them are in Kentucky. American Cancer Society shows that it is lung cancer that pushes Kentucky's cancer rate to the highest in the United States.

        Multiple linear regression result can better display the relationship between cancer and plants.
        Based on th result below, it is confident to say that wind, gas, geothermal, hydro, solar and biomass plants are significant related power plants
        when we consider cancer cases.

        <p><br>
        By plotting clustering graph, we can see there are three clustering with some outliers. 
        However, the clustering results are not good enough to see which counties are grouped together because clusteirngs 
        are very close to each other. It is not clear especially for counties on the border. So, applying this model is not satisfying,
        when study cancer cases, I should consider more.

        Conclusion:<br>
         power plants and Superfund sites have impact on cancer cases of every county in the US.
        However, many risk factors for cancer also should be considered when think about the cause of cancer cases. Because of this, study in cancer
        is still chanllenging and require collboration among different professionals in various settings.
